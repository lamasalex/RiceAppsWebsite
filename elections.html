        <p>Rice Elections is a simple, secure, and transparent way for student organizations to hold online elections. Conduct a secure election for your organization by providing
           the Rice NetIDs of the people who you wish to be eligible to vote. All voters are authenticated through Rice's NetID authentication system, and all ballots cast by voters
            are strictly anonymous! We do not tie your vote choices with your identity. In addition, the voters of an election can see the results after a specified delay. So the
            election is transparent! If you are interested in holding elections for your organization through Owlection, <a href="http://elections.riceapps.org/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
