        <p>The Servery App provides the menus for all of Rice University's dining serveries in one easy-to-read location. The Servery App allows you to compare what's being served at
        each servery so that you, the student, can find what best suits your appetite. The app is stocked with information on current and future meals so that you can plan your day accordingly.
        Users with dining restrictions can utilize the vegetarian and/or gluten-free only functions to view what options that fit their needs are available at each servery as well. Looking
        for information on when each servery is open? The Servery App also provides the hours of operation for each servery, so that you always know where and when to find the best food!</p>
