        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>As students, we often see room for improvement in daily college life processes. Many of these improvements can be made through software projects
            that serve as powerful tools. This initiative aims to provide the program and resources for students to create and improve open-source projects
            at Rice.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to produce multiple projects each year, which can be maintained and improved by future generations of Rice Apps developers.</p>
